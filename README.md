### Date created
Identify Customer Segment project in Python/Jupyter was created on 26-Jan-2022.

### Project Title
**Creating Customer Segments with Arvato**

### Description
In this project, I worked with real-life data provided by Bertelsmann partners
AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. The data here concerns a company that
performs mail-order sales in Germany. Their main question of interest is to
identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their
products for a mailout campaign.

I used unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into
clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base
for the company. Prior to applying the machine learning methods, I assessed and
cleaned the data in order to convert the data into a usable form.

### Files used
Proprietary data from Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Financial Solutions.

Two datasets are used - one with demographic information about the people of Germany,
and one with that same information for customers of a mail-order sales company.

### Output created
